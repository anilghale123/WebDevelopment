           <h1>Anil Ghale</h1>
           <p>"My name is Anil Ghale and I am a highly motivated and experienced web developer with a strong background in various <br>
        programming languages and technologies. I have a proven track record of delivering high-quality, visually appealing and <br>
        user-friendly websites and web applications. <br>
        
        My skillset includes proficiency in HTML, <br>
        
        CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, which I use to create dynamic and responsive front-end designs. I also have experience with <br>
        back-end programming languages such as C++, C, and C#, which allows me to create robust and efficient server-side logic. <br>
        In addition, I have a solid understanding of database management systems such as MySQL and SQL Server, and can <br>
        efficiently design and maintain databases to support web applications. <br>
        
        I am always looking for new and challenging projects to work on, and I am confident that my skills and experience make <br>
        me a valuable asset to any team.</p>
